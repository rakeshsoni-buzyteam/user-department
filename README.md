Pre-requirements:
-- Make an Angular 2+ Project. you can use any version of angular.
-- We have initiated a empty git repository (https://github.com/rakeshsoni-buzyteam/user-department.git). Your first task is to clone the repository and add your whole angular project by committing your first change on git before starting any task. 
-- You have to create a DB in Mysql or mongoDB. (If you know both then we will recommend you to use mongodb)
-- create a User table & Department table for start then you can create more tables according to your need.
-- You need to develop a simple company model in which there are number of employees.
-- Each employee is assigned to one or more departments. 
-- There will be two roles of 'manager' and 'user' on user basis.
-- Each department can contain a sub department which can be treated as separate department. 


This project contains following tasks:
-- You have to create login page.
-- When user login then he will be redirected to user dashboard which will show his/her name and assigned departments. The link on the top should be '/user-dashboard' 
-- when manager login he will be redirected to page where there is list of all departments and users . He can add, edit and delete user name and department from the manager dashboard. The dashboard link on the top should be 'manager-dashboard'
-- If the user entered 'manager-dashboard'  in link to go directly on manager's dashboard then he must be shown with a 404 error page.


Requirements :
-- You need to create simple role based authentication.
-- Redirected paths(routes) must be defined properly.
-- Even though we will see your final project submission, its better that we can see your daily commits or progress. You can commit your daily progress on github.
